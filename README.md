Anemia data processing aims to develop a prediction model that can assist in the early detection of anemia based on clinical and demographic data. By using machine learning techniques, this model is expected to Predict anemia with high accuracy,Identify the main risk factors that contribute to the occurrence of anemia,Improve efficiency in early detection of anemia cases,Identify the best machine learning algorithms for data modeling and classification,Provide prediction to the patient whether anemia or not based on the given factors.
